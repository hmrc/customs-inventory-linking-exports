This API enables the functionality to support the Inventory Linking Export process.  Inventory Linking controls and monitors cargo moving through temporary storage facilities, and allows the movement/transition through frontiers.  
 
There are three functional areas;
 
-  **Consolidation**  This enables the combining of consignments into one master consignment, or splitting into multiple consignments.
-  **Movement**  Records the movement of consignments within Customs controlled storage facilities.
-  **Query**  The querying of data held within the Inventory Linking Export database.

Within each of these functional areas, there are multiple message types, each performing a specific activity.
